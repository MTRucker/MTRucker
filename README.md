- 👋 Hi, I’m @MTRucker also known as Luka
- 👀 I’m interested in mainly games and a bit of programming. Quite new at all of this, and am a student.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Mediainformatics in the University of Tübingen, Germany. I know some Java, some MatLab, and am learning Python and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently, "busy" with University.
- 📫 How to reach me : Discord : MotherTrucker#9540, and that's it.
