- 👋 Hi, I’m @MTRucker also known as Luka
- 👀 I’m interested in mainly games of all kinds and programming. Quite new to all of this, and I've recently graduated in Media Informatics from the University of Tübingen.
- 🌱 I've written my Bachelor's Thesis in (so my highest proffiency is with) Python, but I also know C++, Java, MATLAB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently, I've yet to devise any projects that I might want to pull other people into.
- 📫 How to reach me :
Discord : MotherTrucker#9540
Email : luka.vibovec@gmail.com
LinkedIn : www.linkedin.com/in/luka-vibovec-81347a294
and that's pretty much it. I don't really use social media.
